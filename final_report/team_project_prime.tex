 	\section{\underline{Introduction}}
	In this project, we were tasked with building a multi-host file synchroniser consisting of 3 components: a server, and mobile and desktop client. The server is the "hub" whilst the clients are "spokes". The server was created using Node.js, where it took the role of an interface between both clients and the file-containing database. In addition, the database was created using MongoDB. For both clients, the mobile client was developed using Java and XML on Android Studio, whereas the desktop client was developed using Javascript, HTML and CSS on Electron. The result of this project was a fully-functioning file synchroniser that interacts with and manages multiple, heterogeneous clients via a Node.js server. Furthermore, this synchroniser possesses the ... algorithm that resolves file conflicts caused by clients.
